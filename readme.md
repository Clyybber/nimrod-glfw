About nimrod-glfw
------------------

This is a [Nimrod] bind for [GLFW] library. It's highly experimental right now so it might bite you. 

To Run:
-----------------

Have [Nimrod] installed first. Instructions are [here]. Then just run the included **build.bat** file if you're on Windows. I didn't test it on Linux but it should work just run the same command (inside **build.bat**) in a shell.


History:
-----------------

Found [Nimrod] by chance on the internets. Liked it, saw that it had several bindings for libs like SDL, OpenGL, Lua, Python etc, but no [GLFW] . So decided to make one. 
**The End** :)
